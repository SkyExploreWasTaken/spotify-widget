# Spotify "Now Playing" widget

### ⚠️ This project has his UI ENTIRELY yanked from https://z1.gg/.

To use, you just need to clone it in your website and add these :
  * `<link rel="stylesheet" href="spotify-widget.css">` in `<head>`
  * `<div id="spotify-activity"></div>` in `<body>`
  * `<script src="spotify-widget.js"></script>` just before `</html>`

And you're ready ! Little disclaimer: you need to set your Discord ID in the script.
