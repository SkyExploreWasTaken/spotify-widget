# Spotify "Now Playing" widget

### ⚠️ This project has his UI ENTIRELY yanked from https://z1.gg/.

To use, you just need to import this via an `iframe` :
<iframe src="spotify.html?id=1049263707177353247" style="width:450px; height:182px; border: none; border-radius: 20px;"></iframe>

It's better to keep the iframe styling as it is as I haven't made it responsive right now. It's planned though.
